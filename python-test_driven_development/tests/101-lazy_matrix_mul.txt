Tests for lazy_matrix_mul module
===========================

Import the function:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul = __import__('101-lazy_matrix_mul').lazy_matrix_mul

--- Normal cases ---

Square matrices:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    array([[ 7, 10],
           [15, 22]])

Rectangular matrices:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]])
    array([[13, 16]])

Single element:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[3]], [[4]])
    array([[12]])

With floats:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1.5, 2.5]], [[1, 0], [0, 1]])
    array([[1.5, 2.5]])

Identity matrix:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 0], [0, 1]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]])
    array([[5, 6],
           [7, 8]])

--- ValueError cases ---

m_a is empty:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([], [[1, 2]])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: matmul: Input operand 0 does not have enough dimensions (has 0, gufunc core with signature (n?,k),(k,m?)->(n?,m?) requires 1)

m_b is empty:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: matmul: Input operand 1 does not have enough dimensions (has 0, gufunc core with signature (n?,k),(k,m?)->(n?,m?) requires 1)

Incompatible sizes:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2, 3]])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: matmul: Input operand 1 has a mismatch in its core dimension 0, with gufunc signature (n?,k),(k,m?)->(n?,m?) (size 1 doesn't match 2)

--- TypeError cases ---

m_a is not a list:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul("hello", [[1, 2]])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matmul: Input operand 0 does not support __index__, was coerced to a float, or was converted to a scalar incorrectly.

m_b is not a list:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2]], "hello")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matmul: Input operand 1 does not support __index__, was coerced to a float, or was converted to a scalar incorrectly.

m_a contains strings:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, "two"]], [[1], [2]])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matmul: Input operand 0 does not support __index__, was coerced to a float, or was converted to a scalar incorrectly.

--- Missing arguments ---

No arguments:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: lazy_matrix_mul() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'm_a' and 'm_b'

One argument:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2]])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: lazy_matrix_mul() missing 1 required positional argument: 'm_b'
